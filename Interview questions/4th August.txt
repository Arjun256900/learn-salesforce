1. DML Governor Limits

DML (Data Manipulation Language) means operations like insert, update, upsert and undelete.

Limits: (if exceeded, then DML error)
- Maximum of 150DML statements per transaction
- Maximum of 10k records processed by DML statements per transaction.

What happens if you exceed these?

- Your transaction will fail with a runtime exception like this: 
System.LimitException: Too many DML statements:151

2. SOQL Governor Limits

SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language) is used to fetch data from Salesforce.

Limits:

- Maximum of 100 SOQL queries per transaction

Why does this matter?

- If you exceed the number of SOQL queries, your code will throw an error:
System.LimitException: Too many SOQL queries: 101
If you to process more than 50k records, that query also fails.
